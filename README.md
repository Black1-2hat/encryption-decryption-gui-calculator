The one-time pad is a type of encryption which is unbreakable. A one-time pad will generate a key, this key is shared by both the user so it does encryption as well as decryption. The key used is generated randomly and this key is combined with the plain text in order to form the ciphertext. We can use different algorithms for the generation of the ciphertext such as modular addition, modular XOR, etc. Since the key generated every time is unique, it is impossible to break.
